# 🏡 Smart Hostel Management System

**Department of Computer Science (Namal University, Mianwali)**  
*Course: Software Engineering | Semester Project*

## 📘 Project Overview

The Smart Hostel Management System aims to simplify daily hostel management tasks at Namal University. Currently, processes like room allocation, complaint handling, and student records are manual, causing delays and errors.  
This system provides a digital platform for students and hostel staff to manage hostel operations efficiently.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate hostel records (room allocation, complaints, attendance).  
- Provide wardens and staff an easy way to manage hostel data.  
- Allow students to submit complaints and requests digitally.  
- Reduce paperwork and improve transparency.  
- Offer reports and analytics for decision-making.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Hostel management currently relies on manual record-keeping, which makes tracking requests, complaints, and room assignments slow and error-prone.  
Our project aims to create a centralized system that improves efficiency, accuracy, and user experience.
