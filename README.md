<h2>📘 Project Overview</h2>

The <strong>Smart Hostel Management System</strong> is designed to digitalize and simplify the daily hostel management operations at Namal University.  
Currently, several tasks such as room allocation, complaint handling, event scheduling, and student record management are handled manually, causing inefficiency and data inconsistencies.  

Our proposed system aims to provide a centralized digital platform that will allow students and hostel wardens to manage all hostel-related activities seamlessly and efficiently.

<h2>🧩 Problem Statement</h2>

Currently, Namal University’s hostel management relies heavily on manual record-keeping, making it difficult to maintain accurate data and timely communication between students and hostel staff.  
There is no centralized platform to handle requests, complaints, or room management, resulting in delays and confusion.  
This project aims to build a **Smart Hostel Management System** that automates these processes, improving efficiency, reliability, and user satisfaction.
