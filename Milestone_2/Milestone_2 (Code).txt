\section{General Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sec:product-perspective}
The Smart Hostel Management System (SHMS) is a new custom-developed web-based application which wll be used for Namal University's hostel operations. It addresses limitations in the current minor digital system, such as marking attendance but doesn't know who is missing, time-consuming verifications, and lack of real-time reporting. SHMS represents an evolution from previous tools (e.g., biometric devices for girls' hostel to track in/out) to an integrated platform.
